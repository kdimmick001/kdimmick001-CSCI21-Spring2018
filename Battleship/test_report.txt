            TEST REPORT
--------------------------------------

1. Turn order was able to be generated randomly, as well as being determined by argv.
2. Streams the argv file names appropriately.
3. Switches between turns dependant on who began.
4. Generates a random computer guess.
    a. Reports if it is a miss and updates the gameboard.
    b. If it guesses a hit reports and updates the gameboard.
        i. Loads up the queue with the appropriate surrounding guesses based on the hit.
        ii. If the surrounding guesses in the queue have already been guessed, they are popped off the queue.

        PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED WHEN TESTING  
---------------------------------------------------

1. In order to manipulate the rowcol guesses for the ccomputer, string stream was utilized.
    a. I had used ssin.clear() in an effort to clear the stream between each use.
        i.But this didn't seem to clear the stream of its contents, it just kept adding more rowcol combinations
        and would in turn pop more than one guess off the queue at a time.
        ii.I first looked up the proper use of ssin.clear() to make sure that I was using the function properly.
            1. I kept seeing reports that ssin.str(""); was the only way to have a empty string stream.
                a. When I tried this, once I applied the ssin.str(""); the stream wouldn't let me add anything else to the stream
                instead it seemed to act as a continutously empty stream.
                    i. I found the solution in a combination of the two functions.
                        1. By first implementing ssin.str(""); and then ssin.clear(); the string stream seemed to then work as originally intended.
 
2. Another error I encountered, was with a certain computer guess infinitly looping until reaching a segmentation fault.
    a. When F8 was guessed the program continously kept guessing F8 through the randomly guessed numbers and wouldn't go any father with the guess.
        i. Part of the problem with finding a solution to this, is that I was unable to see the beginning of the looping error
        because, I could not go far enough back to see what the test output was when it began.
